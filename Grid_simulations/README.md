This folder contains all the R code and results obtain from evaluating the sensitivity of the proposed MB-EM algorithm on the set of grid points.
We considered the following choices of the number and/or set of grid points:
* $N=50$ chosen uniformly over the domain of $x$
* $N=n$ and set $\mathcal{U}=x$
* $N=100$ chosen uniformly over the domain of $x$
* $N=500$ chosen uniformly over the domain of $x$
Using a sample of size $n=1000$, the results are virtually the same (see Performance_n=1000.pdf).
